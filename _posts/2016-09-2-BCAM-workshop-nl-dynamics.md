On september 1-2 2016, I attended the *2nd BCAM Workshop on Nonlinear Dynamics in
 Biological Systems*. It was held in the [Basque Center for Applied Mathematics (BCAM)](http://www.bcamath.org/es/),
 that is located at Bilbao, Spain.

It was an amazing workshop, with a strong emphasis both on theory and on experiments. I highly recommend visiting BCAM!

In this workshop I presented a poster, *An hybrid automaton approach
of a multi-scale hemoglobin production model*, part of a collaboration with T. Dang, E. Fanchon, V. Magron, and A. Rocca.
