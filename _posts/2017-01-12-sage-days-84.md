In two months time, I'll participate in [Sage Days 84: Polytopes in Sage](https://wiki.sagemath.org/days84). The meeting will take place at the city of Olot in the province of Catalunya, Spain. 
 

During my stay at Faber I would like to contribute to the Sage mathematical software project. Free software projects such as Sage, rather than a "solo" activity, evolve by virtue of the sum of efforts of individuals (developers, in the jargon). This represents a great opportunity to link with experienced Sage developers and to foster a sense of community. I'll focus on improving the geometry and mathematical optimization libraries, and to write documentation. I hope these efforts will advance my own research projects/teaching, and also to be useful for people using Sage.


I look forward to these Sage days!
