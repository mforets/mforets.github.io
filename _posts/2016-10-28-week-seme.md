On the week of 24-28 October 2016, I participated in the [Semaine d'Étude Maths-Info Entreprises (SEMIE)](http://semie.imag.fr/). It was held at the Campus de Saint Martin d'Hères (Grenoble).

Our project was entitled: *Virtual agents and a humanoid robot*. The robot used for experimentation was NAO, from Aldebaran Robotics.
