The week of 23-26 January I followed an outstanding course *Partial Differential Equation Methods in Control*, given by Prof. [Eduardo Cerpa](ecerpa.mat.utfsm.cl/), from the Mathematics Department of Universidad Técnica
Federico Santa María (Valparaíso, Chile). Sessions took place at [GIPSA](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/le-laboratoire/presentation.php)-lab.


Below you will find some extra information. 

> **Content:**
In this course we study controllability and stabilization methods for
infinite-dimensional systems described by partial differential equations
(PDEs). Classical PDEs as the transport equation, the heat equation, and
the wave equation are considered in detail. Moreover, other models as
the Korteweg-de Vries equation and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation are
studied from a control viewpoint.
