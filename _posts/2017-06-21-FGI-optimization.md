The forthcoming [18th French-German-Italian Conference on Optimization](https://math.uni-paderborn.de/fgi-2017/) will take place in Paderborn (Germany). This year it will host the [minisymposia](https://math.uni-paderborn.de/ag/mathematik-und-ihre-anwendungen/fgi-2017/minisymposia/).  

I look forward to attending the session **Hierarchies of SDP Relaxations for Polynomial Systems**. We will contribute the paper *Semidefinite Characterization of Invariant Measures*, joint work with V. Magron and D. Henrion.

The conference will address all aspects of optimization and its applications, including:

- continuous optimization (smooth and nonsmooth)
- optimal control and calculus of variations
- optimization with PDE
- numerical methods for mathematical programming
- robust optimization
- mixed integer optimization
- differential inclusions and set-valued analysis
- stochastic optimization
- multicriteria optimization
- optimization techniques for industrial applications
