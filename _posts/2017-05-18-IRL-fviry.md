[Introduction a la recherche en laboratoire](https://ensiwiki.ensimag.fr/index.php/Introduction_A_La_Recherche_En_Laboratoire_2A) is a course proposed at the [Ensimag engineering school](http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/) (2nd year), and the aim is that students develop a (small) research project in a research team. 

This semester, I was the co-tutor (together with [Goran Frehse](https://sites.google.com/site/frehseg/)), of [Frédéric Viry](https://github.com/viryfrederic/), who worked in the project:

> *Reachability of high-dimensional dynamical systems through low-dimensional projections.*

In this project, a new decomposition-based strategy is built for the reachability analysis of high-dimensional affine systems. Moreover, Frédéric developed a [Julia](https://discourse.julialang.org/) module for efficient reachability analysis in low dimensions which uses support functions as set representations.
