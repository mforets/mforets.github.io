On 10th Dec, 2015 I defended my PhD thesis in Mathematics and Informatics at
Université Joseph Fourier (which in 2016 became Université Grenoble Alpes).

My PhD advisors were Pablo Arrighi and Alain Joye. I am grateful for their constant support during these three years of work.

You will find a PDF version of the thesis,
[*Marches quantiques et Mécanique Quantique Relativiste*](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01253797),
in the HAL repository (French acronym for *hyper-articles en ligne*).

The main topics of my PhD thesis are:

- Quantum walks and quantum cellular automata.
- Quantum simulation of physical systems. The Dirac equation.
- Spectral analysis of unitary operators.
