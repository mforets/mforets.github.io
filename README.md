### Short bio

<p class="message">
  Marcelo Forets is a researcher working on scientific computing and mathematical methods for engineering sciences. He was born in Uruguay (Montevideo, 1988), graduated in Physics from Univ. de la Republica (Facultad de Ciencias), and then in Electrical Engineering (Facultad de Ingenieria). He moved to France for a PhD in Mathematics and Informatics (Univ. Joseph Fourier, 2013-2015), writing a thesis on quantum computational models and mathematical physics of the quantum random walk. He is currently a second year post-doc researcher at VERIMAG laboratory of Université Grenoble Alpes, and his research interests lie in the frontier of applied mathematics (optimization, numerical analysis) and formal verification (continuous and hybrid dynamical systems, robust control).

### Presentation

Hi! My name is Marcelo Forets, I am Uruguayan, and I made my undergraduate studies at Universidad de la Republica (Montevideo, Uruguay).

I hold a PhD in Mathematics and Informatics from [UGA](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/
) (Dec' 2015). My PhD advisors were [Pablo Arrighi](http://pageperso.lif.univ-mrs.fr/~pablo.arrighi/) (Professor at Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale, Aix-Marseille Université) and [Alain Joye](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~joye/) (Professor at Institut Fourier, Université Grenoble Alpes).

I am a former post-doc researcher at TEMPO team led by [Oded Maler](http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~maler/) (CNRS Researcher at VERIMAG, Univ. Grenoble Alpes). It is located at [VERIMAG](http://www-verimag.imag.fr/) laboratory, from [Universite Grenoble Alpes](http://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) (Grenoble, France). My post-doc was directed by [Goran Frehse](http://www.sites.google.com/site/frehseg/) (MdC at VERIMAG, Univ. Grenoble Alpes). During my stay in VERIMAG, I was able to collaborate with several people in the lab and other institutions; check the [Collaborators section](http://main.marcelo-forets.fr/collaborators) for further details.

Currently, I am in charge of the Mechanics and Energy course at [UTEC](https://utec.edu.uy/), Uruguay, for the career: Renewable Energy Engineering.

### Topics of current research activity
