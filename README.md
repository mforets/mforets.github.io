### Short bio

Marcelo Forets is a researcher and developer working on formal verification of dynamical systems. He develops innovative numerical methods that impact decisions regarding correctness and safety of mechanical, electronic or cyber-physical systems.

He was born in Uruguay (Montevideo, 1988), graduated in Physics from Univ. de la República (Facultad de Ciencias), and then in Electrical Engineering (Facultad de Ingeniería). He moved to France for a PhD in Mathematics and Informatics (Univ. Joseph Fourier, 2013-2015), writing a thesis on quantum computational models and mathematical physics of the quantum mechanical version of the random walk. He is a former post-doc researcher of VERIMAG laboratory of Université Grenoble Alpes, a leading research institute on verification and cyber-physical systems research. He is currently one of the lead developers of JuliaReach, an open-source software toolbox for reachability computations of dynamical systems.
